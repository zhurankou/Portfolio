      <h1>My Story</h1>
      <p>Hi, my name is Aleksei. I was born and raised in Belarus and Iâ€™ve been passionate about visual arts since the very young age. My first memory of myself drawing was at the age of six. I drew mountains, military aircraft, and ocean. Who knew back in those days that my childhood drawings will become a reality in the future.</p>
      <p>After high school, I went to the Academy of Ministry of Internal Affairs to study Jurisprudence. Among the reasons behind this decision were earning Bachelorâ€™s degree in Law for free, avoiding mandatory military service, and getting a guaranteed job after the graduation. Thatâ€™s how I ended up being a police investigator for several years.</p>

    <p>I might have been doing this job even now, but 10 years ago I won the DV-Program lottery and got a chance to immigrate to the United States. Even though I had no language skills, no foreseeable job, and a newborn baby on hands, I decided to take the chance and leave everything behind.</p>
    <p>My early days in America were not fun. Iâ€™ve worked a graveyard shift at a factory, been unemployed, and worked as a janitor. The only way out for me was joining the military. After serving one term in the Navy, I decided to not re-enlist and follow my passion. My whole life I've been always doing what I had to do and this time around I got a chance to start from scratch.</p>
    <p>I went to study Digital Design at a community college, not knowing much about the Tech Industry. While being at school, I found myself interested in the user experience and eventually realized that I would really like to work on human-computer interactions. Therefore, after graduation from the college, I transferred to the University of Washington to study Interaction Design.</p>
    <p>Besides the user experience and interface design, I'm also very passionate about the development. I really enjoy to challenge myself with learning new technologies, such as React JS (360 and Native), Graph QL, and exploring new design tools, like Sketch, Figma, Framer, and Origami. Among other things that excite me the most are design and development collaboration and productivity. </p>
    <p>I love my family, outdoors, and chill music. I also care about accessibility and environmental sustainability.</p>
    <p>Thanks for stopping by, and let's get in touch!</p>
